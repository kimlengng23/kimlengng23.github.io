											<h3><strong>Fablix</strong></h3>
											<p class="description">Fablix was a 10-week-long project in my Web and Mobile Development class.
											It is an application which mimics online shopping applications, allowing users to
											view, search for, add, and purchase items. I worked on both front and back-end.
											I set up 3 servers - master, slave, and load balancer and wrote code to handle requests.
											I decided how the application should look and wrote front-end scripts.
											The main technologies that I used were MySQL, Apache Tomcat, Java Servlet, JavaScript, Android Studio...

											<h3><strong>Computer Network Labs</strong></h3>
											<p class="description">In Advance Computer Networking, I did several labs and experimented many different networking senerios. 
											All the labs virtually were done on GNS3, using a few other tools such as VMWare, Linux terminal, virtual Cisco router,
											Cisco router console, and Wireshark. I set up, tested, and wrote reports on network.

											<h3><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms projects</strong></h3>
											<p class="description">In my final year, I worked on 3 advanced projects. The first project was selecting K largest elements from an array
											without knowing the content of the array, yet there was a function that showed which element was greater in a pair of elements.
											The goal was to use as few comparisions as possible. The second project was finding the majority using a group count function. 
											Provided an array without the content, I had to find the majority using a group count function as few times as possible. 
											Last but not least, the third project focused on file compression with Lempel-Ziv algorithm. Using some data structure, 
											I had to compress and decompress files within a short period of time.</p>

											<h3><strong>Star Rating Predictor</strong></h3>
											<p class="description">The program was written in Python for ML and AI project class. There were a few ML models which I used for the project,
											but the primary model was Neural Network. The models were trained using Yelp dataset. There were several techniques which 
											were used such as tokenizing, n-gram, tagging part of speech, stemming, finding weight of words. </p>

											<h3><strong>Smart Agent of Wampus World</strong></h3>
											<p class="description">An agent written in Java could play Wampus World. To beat the game, the agent must go into the cave, retrieve gold, and escape
											by staying alive. My agent was one of the top 20 agents in my AI class.</p>

											<h3><strong>Romanized and Khmer Unicode Convertor</strong></h3>
											<p class="description">The convertor can convert Romanized Khmer words to Unicode Khmer words and vice-versa. To achieve the result, 
											I created a map which contained Khmer characters and words and their corresponding Romanized characters and words.</p>

											<h3><strong>Simulton</strong></h3>
											<p class="description">At the very end of the my Python programming class, I made an app called Simulton which involved using OOP 
											and GUI from Tkinter package. The app allows users to spawn balls, floaters, black holes, hunters. 
											What balls can do is bound from one end of the screen to the others. Floaters are similar to balls except they 
											move randomly in both direction and speed. Black holes stay still, but will eat anything that comes close to them. 
											Last but not least, hunters chase and eat anything that is the closest to them, but if they cannot find anything to eat for 5 seconds, 
											they will get smaller and eventually die out.</p>

											<h3><strong>Othello, the game</strong></h3>
											<p class="description">As part of the Python programming class, I made a game called Othello also known as Reversi. 
											There were two separated parts of the project. The first one was just the game without 
											the nice graphical user interface. Later, I improved the game by reusing the modules I had created and 
											adding graphical user interface using Tkinter package.</p>

											<h3><strong>Drone-based Gas Detector</strong></h3>
											<p class="description">Attached to a drone, the detector was made on an Arduino board and a circuit board with a few other components
											 such as Bluetooth, GPS sensor, and gas sensor. The detector could detect toxic gas and send amount of gas and the gas location it detected to a phone.
											 The detector could be useful in detecting toxic gas in unaccessible areas. I programmed the detector in C++ and made a graphical application that produced
											 heat maps in Java. </p>

											<h3><strong>Library Management System</strong></h3>
											<p class="description">My assignment in Intro to Database class was creating an application on Microsoft Access to mimic an actual library Management System. 
											The application allowed users to keep records of readers, books, borrowing, and returning. I created tables, forms, and wrote code to handle events.</p>
										</div>

										<div class="col-sm-8">
											<h3><strong>Poker</strong></h3>
											<p class="description">Poker is a gambling machine that is often seen at casinos. When I first learned programming, Poker was my first 
											game that I have ever created. The game was made in C language.</p>
